## MongoDB and ENV

In order to set up a MongoDB database (or any sort of databse for that matter), it's best practice to create a `.env` file, which contains the app's sensitive information

```env
DATABASE=mongodb://user:pass@host.com:port/database
PORT=7777
MAP_KEY=456123
SECRET=twizzlers
```

The `dotenv` node package is used to reference the `.env` file. It stores the data for access as a `process.env` object (created by calling `require('dotenv').config({path: filename.env})`).

The template for the database connection is used in mongoDB specifically in order to connect. For example, a `localhost` example (without a username/password), connecting to the `admin` database on port `27017` would be:

```
DATABASE=mongodb://localhost:27017/admin
```

Another important note, if you are setting up MongoDB on your local machine (instead of using a DB as a Service), and it happens to be running Windows, you will have to create a `C:\data\db` directory in order setup. To actually make it run, navigate to `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\versionNumber\bin` and run `mongod` in a terminal. Congrats, you've spun up your database. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

## Routing

Routing is the way of sending our app/user different sets of data based on the URL path. For this project, `express.Router()` is used for this.

The router let's us specify the file path, and the type of request, followed by what to do with it. See the following:

```javascript
const router = express.Router();
//Perform this function for GET requests on homepage
router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  //req -> request object
  //res -> response object
  //next -> operation for middleware (more on this later)
  //req.query -> references localhost:PORT/?key1=value1&key2=value2
  //res.send() -> sends page data, ex: <p>Hello World!</p>
  //res.json() -> send JSON object (for API calls)
  const me = {
    name: "leander",
    age: 19,
    other: req.query.other
  };
  res.json(me);
});
//Use the controller's addPage function to control the POST requests on localhost:PORT/add
router.post("/add", storeController.addStore);
```

## Middleware and Error Handling

```javascript
//TODO
// - app.use() (global middleware)
// - next() sequential middleware
// - after request, before response
```

## Templating, Helpers and Mixins

**Templates** are a useful way to write reusable markup. For this app, the templating language used is `pug` (or formerly known as `jade`). which was chosen for its seemless integration with JavaScript.

The syntax of the templating language depends on which is chosen, but regardless, the core concept is the same; create a page which can accept data to dynamically create a new page.

```javascript
//Use pug as the template engine
app.set("view engine", "pug");

//This is a controller, which is helpful for MVC programming. More on this later...
exports.addStore = (req, res) => {
  //The response renders a template 'editStore.pug', and passes the template data
  res.render("editStore", { title: "Hello World!" });
};

/*  ---- Within editStore.pug ----  */

extends layout //Use the layout.pug template

block content //Change the 'content' block of layout.pug to the following markup
  //Reference the supplied parameters
  h2 #{title}
  h3= title
```

**Helpers** are another useful way to write templates. They allow you to perform some basic functionality/operations on the incoming data for each template. Simple things like loops over arrays, key-value destructuring, comparators, and conditionals are all available for most templating languages.

In order to create your own helpers, simple put them in a `helpers.js` file as:

```javascript
exports.example = "example value";
exports.dump = obj => JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2);
```

or something of the sort. Then, using middleware, they can be used in Express:

```javascript
//Import the file
const helpers = require("./helpers.js");

//Add it as a helper
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.locals.h = helpers;
  next();
});

//Use it throught the app (ex. pug)
h1 This is how a helper is used: #{h.example}
```

**Mixins** are a way of extending the modularity even further, essentially creating reusable components for multiple templates. For example, if your `updateStore.pug` template, and `addStore.pug` template both present the same form, with the same parameters, a `_storeForm.pug` mixin is probably a good idea.

_Note: To distinguish mixins, it is recommended to store them in a separate directory, with filenames starting with an underscore._

In pug, mixins can be referenced and used as follows:

```pug
extends layout

include mixins/_storeForm

block content
  h1 Preceding data
  +storeForm({store: 'Cool Cats'})

<!-- Within _storeForm.pug -->
//- Declared similar to JS functions
mixin storeForm(store = '')
  //- Your template with its param values
  h1= store
```

**Take advantage of templating, it's a useful tool!**

## MVC and Controllers

MVC programming is a code architecture concept. It stands for **Model**, **View**, **Controller**. It outlines a way of developing applications to process logic and display content to end users by separating the code into three distinct areas

### Model

The model refers to the diagram, or blue-print of the app. This could be seen as the database schema, or the routing.

```javascript
//TODO
```

### View

```javascript
//TODO
```

### Controller

```javascript
//TODO
```
